SimpleCMS
==
SimpleCMS is a project I'm developing to improve my developer skill-set. The project is a boilerplate for a fully-functional CMS and includes built-in authorisation/authentication along with a configurable web-client. SimpleCMS is built using the clean architecture methodology (as outlined by Jason Taylor [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lwCVE_XgqI)). 

This project is primarily a learning tool so hopefully you get something out of it!


Objectives
--
- Create a foundation on which a CMS can be built with minimal effort.
- Implement secure authorisation/authentication
- Build a configurable web-client that is robust and easy to use.
- Learn lots
